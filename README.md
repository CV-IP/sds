Code for SDS

This repository implements the ideas from our [CVPR 2015 paper](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bharath2/pubs/pdfs/BharathCVPR2015.pdf) and [my thesis](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2015/EECS-2015-193.html). In particular, it uses the hypercolumn representation to segment detections. It uses ideas from [SPP](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4729) and [Fast R-CNN](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08083). The full details are in Chapter 3 of my thesis (look at Figure 3.7 for an overview).

This README is under construction.
